# Digital Garden 🌱

> "I wasn't going to eat it, I was just going to taste it." — Winnie the Pooh

Welcome. This is my digital garden—a collection of notes, ideas, and explorations that grow over time.

My name is **Hrishikesh Bhaskaran** and I am a Software Engineer, currently working as the VP of Engineering at [Entri](https://entri.app).

This is a [digital garden](digital_garden) where I share things I know about this world. Unlike blog posts ordered by dates, this is an interlinked web of living documents that evolve as I learn.
