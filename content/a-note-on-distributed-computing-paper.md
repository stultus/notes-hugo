**A Note on Distributed Computing** is a seminal paper arguing against the "unified view" of objects in distributed systems.

The unified view assumes that objects (local or remote) form a single ontological class defined only by their interfaces. The paper asserts this is mistaken: there are fundamental differences between local and distributed interactions that cannot be abstracted away.

> "Work in distributed object-oriented systems that is based on a model that ignores or denies these differences is doomed to failure."
