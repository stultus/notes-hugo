**AI Adoption** is the process of integrating artificial intelligence tools and practices into an organization's workflows and systems.

## Key Insight: Systems Problem, Not Tools Problem

According to [DORA's 2025 research](https://dora.dev/research/2025/dora-report/), successful AI adoption is fundamentally a **systems problem, not a tools problem**. AI acts as an amplifier—magnifying an organization's existing strengths and weaknesses.

The greatest returns on AI investment come not from the tools themselves, but from strategic focus on the underlying organizational system:

- **[Internal Platform](internal-platform)**: Well-designed platforms amplify AI benefits
- **Data Ecosystem**: Quality data infrastructure enables better AI outcomes
- **Core Engineering Disciplines**: Strong fundamentals multiply AI effectiveness

## Trust but Verify

Organizations need processes to:
- Critically guide AI-generated work
- Evaluate AI outputs against standards
- Validate AI recommendations before implementation

Without verification systems, AI can amplify errors and poor practices as easily as it amplifies good ones.
