**Analytically Operational Data** is data that automatically helps someone (or some system) make better decisions without requiring human intervention.

## Characteristics

- **Real-time**: Updated and processed in near real-time
- **Actionable**: Directly triggers automated decisions or recommendations
- **Integrated**: Combines operational and analytical capabilities
- **Automated**: Decisions are made by systems, not humans
- **Context-aware**: Uses current operational context with analytical insights

## Purpose

This type of data enables:
- Automated decision-making systems
- Real-time recommendations
- Dynamic pricing and personalization
- Automated fraud detection
- Self-optimizing systems

## Examples

- Recommendation engines (e.g., "customers who bought this also bought")
- Dynamic pricing systems
- Automated fraud detection in transactions
- Real-time inventory optimization
- Personalized content delivery

## Relationship to Other Data Types

Analytically Operational Data bridges [Operational Data](operational-data) and [Analytical Data](analytical-data):
- Uses analytical insights (from analytical data)
- Applies them in operational contexts (like operational data)
- Automates the decision-making process

## Related Concepts

- [Operational Data](operational-data) — transactional data
- [Analytical Data](analytical-data) — decision-support data
- [ELT (Extract - Load - Transform)](elt) — data processing approach
- [AI Adoption](ai-adoption) — using AI for automated decisions
- [Architecture Decision (AD)](architecture-decision)
