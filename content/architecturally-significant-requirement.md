An **architecturally-significant requirement (ASR)** is any requirement—functional or non-functional—that has a measurable effect on a software system’s architecture. ASRs drive structural decisions, influence trade-offs, and often manifest as quality attributes such as scalability, performance, security, or reliability.

## Why ASRs Matter

- Guide architectural choices and trade-offs
- Expose quality attributes that shape structure
- Help prioritize work in Architecture Decision Records
- Provide early warning when requirements threaten feasibility
