An **Architecture Decision Log (ADL)** is the collection of all [Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)](architecture-decision-records) created and maintained for a particular project or organization.

## Purpose

An ADL serves as:
- A centralized repository of architectural decisions
- A historical record of how the system evolved
- A reference for understanding past decisions and their context
- A tool for onboarding new team members
- A way to track decision states and changes over time

## Organization

ADLs are typically organized by:
- Chronological order (by decision date)
- Status (proposed, accepted, deprecated, etc.)
- Domain or subsystem
- Related [Architecturally-significant Requirements (ASRs)](architecturally-significant-requirement)

## Related Concepts

- [Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)](architecture-decision-records) — the individual records that make up an ADL
- [Architecture Decision (AD)](architecture-decision) — the decisions documented in ADRs
- [Architecturally-significant Requirement (ASR)](architecturally-significant-requirement)
- [Engineering Strategy](engineering-strategy)
