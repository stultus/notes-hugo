An **Architecture Decision Record (ADR)** is a document that captures an important [Architecture Decision (AD)](architecture-decision) made along with its context and consequences.

## Structure

A typical ADR includes:
- **Title**: Short description of the decision
- **Status**: Proposed, accepted, deprecated, superseded
- **Context**: What forces are at play
- **Decision**: What we decided to do
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or harder

## Purpose

ADRs help:
- Document why decisions were made
- Preserve context for future team members
- Enable better decision-making over time
- Create institutional memory
- Avoid revisiting settled decisions
