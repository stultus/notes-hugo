**Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** are lightweight documents that capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences.

## Structure

A typical ADR includes:
- **Title**: Short description of the decision
- **Status**: Proposed, accepted, deprecated, superseded
- **Context**: What forces are at play
- **Decision**: What we decided to do
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or harder

## Purpose

ADRs help:
- Document why decisions were made
- Preserve context for future team members
- Enable better decision-making over time
- Create institutional memory
- Avoid revisiting settled decisions
