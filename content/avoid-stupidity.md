**Avoid Stupidity** is the principle that avoiding stupidity is easier than trying to be brilliant.

## Core Approach

## Method

- Identify obvious failure points
- Steer clear of them
- Focus on eliminating mistakes rather than optimizing for brilliance

## Mental Model

This approach uses the mental model of [Inversion](inversion) — looking at problems from the opposite perspective.
