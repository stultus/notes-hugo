**Boundary Setting** is defining and communicating your limits—what you will and won't accept, what you can and can't do, and how you want to be treated.

## Why Boundaries Matter

- **Protects values**: Prevents compromise, maintains integrity
- **Prevents burnout**: Protects time and energy
- **Improves relationships**: Clear expectations reduce conflict
- **Enables better decisions**: Helps say no to wrong things

## How to Set Boundaries

1. **Identify limits**: What makes you uncomfortable? What drains energy?
2. **Communicate clearly**: Be direct, use "I" statements, be consistent
3. **Enforce consistently**: Follow through, be firm but respectful
4. **Respect others' boundaries**: Model what you expect

## Challenges

- Guilt and fear of disappointing others
- Pushback and pressure to change
- Finding balance: not too rigid, not too loose
