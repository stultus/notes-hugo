I learned about the Chinese settlement in Calicut from Manu S Pillai's *The Ivory Throne*. It's a fascinating piece of Kerala's maritime history that's often overlooked.

During the reign of the Ming emperors, massive Chinese vessels regularly visited Kozhikode (Calicut). Thousands of Chinese soldiers lived in Calicut, and they left behind a half Chinese half-Malayali community called **Chinna Kribala**.

Even after the arrival of the Chinese ceased, this lineage of mixed Malayali and Chinese heritage remained in Kozhikode. **Chinali**, the famous pirate and sailor, was born into this lineage.

## Archaeological Evidence

There is considerable evidence of Ming Chinese settlement in **Panthalayini Kollom** (not Calicut itself). According to Dr. Raghava Varier, this medieval port was the main ship repair centre, and all Chinese ships had to dock here. During test digging in Elayedath paramba and Illath paramba in Panthalayani Kollom, Chinese ceramic sherds were found at a depth of 1 metre.

Karashima identifies the Chinese "Gulifo" with Panthalayini Kollom (and not Calicut, as some had erroneously assumed). The findings were published by Taisho University Press in 2004.
