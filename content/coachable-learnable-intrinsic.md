**Coachable, Learnable, and Intrinsic** is a framework for understanding how different skills and qualities can be developed, particularly useful in hiring and talent development contexts.

## The Three Categories

### Coachable Skills
**External help makes a substantial difference**

Skills where coaching, training, and mentorship have significant impact:
- Tactics and techniques
- Process and methodology
- Critical thinking frameworks
- Communication patterns
- Domain knowledge

**Development approach**: Provide training, mentorship, and structured learning opportunities.

### Learnable Skills
**Needs external help, but the biggest battle is internal**

Skills that require both external guidance and significant internal work:
- Cognitive empathy
- High agency
- Deep focus
- Judgment
- Creativity

**Development approach**: Provide resources and guidance, but success depends primarily on individual motivation and internal work.

### Intrinsic Qualities
**Largely inborn or acquired in childhood**

Fundamental character traits and drives:
- Drive and motivation
- Integrity
- Curiosity
- Deep care
- Ownership mindset

**Development approach**: Very difficult to change; screen for these during hiring. Changes typically require major life transformations or decades of work.

## Key Principles

### Binary Nature of Some Intrinsics
Some intrinsic qualities are binary rather than gradual:
- "There is no such thing as 'medium integrity' because medium integrity is low integrity"
- Either present or absent; no meaningful middle ground

### Time Horizons
- **Coachable**: Weeks to months
- **Learnable**: Months to years
- **Intrinsic**: Decades or never (without major life transformation)

## Hiring Implications

### What to Screen For
**Prioritize intrinsic qualities in hiring**:
- These are hardest to develop
- Foundation for everything else
- Binary qualities (like integrity) are non-negotiable

### What to Develop
**Invest in coachable and learnable skills**:
- Coachable: High ROI on training investment
- Learnable: Support with resources, but expect individual ownership

### What to Accept
**Don't expect to change intrinsic qualities**:
- Hire for drive, integrity, curiosity
- Don't hire hoping these will develop

## Applications Beyond Hiring

### Team Development
- Identify which gaps are coachable (invest in training)
- Recognize learnable skills (provide resources, expect self-work)
- Accept intrinsic limitations (work with what you have)

### Self-Development
- Seek coaching for coachable skills
- Take ownership of learnable skills
- Understand your intrinsic qualities (strengths and limitations)

### Performance Management
- Coach on tactics and process
- Support learning of judgment and creativity
- Don't try to "fix" intrinsic qualities

## Critiques and Nuances

### Not Completely Fixed
Some argue that even "intrinsic" qualities can be developed with:
- Right techniques and frameworks
- Sustained effort over time
- Specific interventions

**Note**: Andrey F. in the LinkedIn comments recommends **"The Attributes" by Rich Divine**, which apparently provides techniques for adjusting what are typically considered "intrinsic" qualities (including curiosity, drive, and care). The book suggests we can teach our brains to be more curious and adjust other attributes with the right approach.

*To explore: Read "The Attributes" by Rich Divine to understand techniques for developing intrinsic qualities.*

### Context Matters
The same quality might be more or less developable depending on:
- Individual starting point
- Available support systems
- Life circumstances and motivation
