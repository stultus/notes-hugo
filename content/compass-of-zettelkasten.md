The **Compass of Zettelkasten** is a method for exploring ideas by placing one idea (X) in the center and using four compass directions to give definition to the idea in different ways.

## The Method

1. Take one idea (X) and put it in the centre
2. Imagine the four compass directions. Each direction helps give definition to the idea in different ways.

### NORTH: "Where does X come from?"

- What are its origins?
- What group/category does X belong to?
- What exists an order of magnitude higher?
- Zoom out. What gave birth to X?
- What causes X?

### WEST: "What is similar to X?"

- What other disciplines could X already exist in?
- What other disciplines could benefit from X?
- What are other ways to say/do X?

### SOUTH: "Where can X lead to?"

- What does X contribute to?
- What group/category could X be the headline of?
- What exists an order of magnitude lower?
- Zoom in. What does X nurture?

### EAST: "What competes with X?"

- What is the opposite of X?
- What is X missing?
- Its disadvantage?
- What could supercharge X?
