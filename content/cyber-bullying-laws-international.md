Cyberbullying is a growing concern globally, and many countries have enacted laws to address it:

* **United States**: Generally not a federal crime, but prosecuted under state laws or as a violation of federal civil rights laws. Many states have specific laws and task forces.
* **Canada**: Addressed through existing harassment/intimidation laws. The *Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act (2013)* criminalizes non-consensual distribution of intimate images.
* **United Kingdom**: Covered under the *Malicious Communications Act, 1988* and the *Protection from Harassment Act, 1997*.
* **Australia**: Addressed through state/territory laws on stalking and harassment. Initiatives include the *National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children (2013)* and a national reporting system.
