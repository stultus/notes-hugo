**"When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."**
- Sherlock Holmes (Arthur Conan Doyle), *The Sign of Four*

Systematically rule out what cannot be true; what remains must be the answer, even if it seems unlikely.

## The Method

1. Gather all possibilities
2. Eliminate the impossible using facts and logic
3. Accept what remains (verify when possible)

## Why This Works

- Forces systematic thinking, preventing jumping to conclusions
- Handles unlikely truths we might otherwise dismiss
- Builds confidence through rigorous elimination

## Limitations

- Requires discrete, finite possibilities
- Needs clear criteria for "impossible"
- Remaining answer may still need verification

## Related Concepts

- [Legend of Prester John](prester-john) - Historical example: as geographic knowledge improved, Europeans eliminated the impossible (no such universal priest-king existed)
