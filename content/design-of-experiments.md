**Design of Experiments (DoE, DOX, or experimental design)** is a formal way to design a task that explains the variation under conditions.

## Purpose

DoE provides a systematic approach to:
- Identify which factors influence outcomes
- Understand relationships between variables
- Optimize processes and systems
- Make data-driven decisions with controlled experiments

## Key Principles

- **Control**: Compare experimental groups to control groups
- **Randomization**: Reduce bias by random assignment
- **Replication**: Repeat experiments to verify results
- **Blocking**: Account for known sources of variation

## Applications

- Scientific research
- Product development and optimization
- Process improvement
- A/B testing and experimentation
- Quality control
