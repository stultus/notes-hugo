A **Digital Garden** (or Zettelkasten / Second Brain) is a personal tool for thinking and writing that uses hypertextual features to create a web of thought.

Unlike a blog (chronological), a garden is:
- **Interlinked**: Notes are connected by context, not just date.
- **Living**: Notes are constantly edited and refined ([Digital Garden Workflow](digital-garden-workflow)).
- **Exploratory**: Designed for wandering and discovery.
