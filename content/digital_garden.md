A **Digital Garden** (or [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) / Second Brain) is a personal tool for thinking and writing that uses hypertextual features to create a web of thought.

## What Makes It Different

Unlike a blog (chronological), a garden is:
- **Interlinked**: Notes are connected by context, not just date
- **Living**: Notes are constantly edited and refined, not static posts at a point in time
- **Exploratory**: Designed for wandering and discovery
- **Non-linear**: Ideas connect in multiple directions

## Philosophy

In basic terms, it is a different format for written content on the web. It's about moving away from blog posts ordered by dates and categories, into more of an interlinked web of notes. Blog posts are articles at a point in time, while a digital garden is a living document.

Digital gardens are also known as [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) or Second Brain. They can be used to develop [new transformative tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/).
