**DORA** (DevOps Research and Assessment) is a research program run by Google Cloud that studies software delivery performance and organizational practices.

DORA is best known for identifying key metrics that predict software delivery performance:
- **Deployment Frequency**: How often code is deployed to production
- **Lead Time for Changes**: Time from code commit to production
- **Change Failure Rate**: Percentage of deployments causing failures
- **Time to Restore Service**: Time to recover from failures

## Research
DORA publishes annual reports on the state of DevOps and software delivery. The [2025 report](https://dora.dev/research/2025/dora-report/) focuses on AI-assisted software development.
