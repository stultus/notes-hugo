The **Dunning-Kruger Effect** is a cognitive bias whereby people with low ability, expertise, or experience regarding a certain type of task or area of knowledge tend to overestimate their ability or knowledge.

## The Effect

- **Low performers**: Tend to overestimate their ability or knowledge
- **High performers**: Some researchers also include their tendency to underestimate their skills

## Why It Happens

People with low ability lack the metacognitive skills to recognize their own incompetence. They don't know what they don't know.

## Criticisms
