# Eisenhower Matrix

The **Eisenhower Matrix** (also known as the Urgent-Important Matrix) is a time management and prioritization framework that categorizes tasks based on two dimensions: **urgency** and **importance**.

## The Four Quadrants

### Quadrant 1: Urgent and Important
**Do First** - Tasks that require immediate attention and have significant consequences.

Examples: Crises, deadlines, emergencies

### Quadrant 2: Important but Not Urgent
**Schedule** - Tasks that contribute to long-term goals but don't require immediate action.

Examples: Planning, relationship building, skill development, prevention

### Quadrant 3: Urgent but Not Important
**Delegate** - Tasks that need immediate attention but don't contribute to important goals.

Examples: Some emails, interruptions, meetings that could be handled by others

### Quadrant 4: Neither Urgent nor Important
**Eliminate** - Tasks that waste time and don't contribute to goals.

Examples: Time-wasting activities, excessive social media, busywork

## Key Principle

> "What is important is seldom urgent and what is urgent is seldom important." — Dwight D. Eisenhower

The goal is to spend more time in **Quadrant 2** (Important but Not Urgent) to prevent tasks from becoming urgent crises.

## Why It Matters

- **Focus on what matters**: Distinguishes between urgent and important
- **Prevent crises**: Investing in Quadrant 2 prevents Quadrant 1 emergencies
- **Reduce time waste**: Identifies tasks to eliminate or delegate
- **Better decision-making**: Provides clear framework for task prioritization
