To create a **footnote** in Markdown:

1. Append a caret and label in square brackets: `[^1]`
2. Define the footnote elsewhere: `[^1]: This is the footnote text.`

```markdown
This is a sentence with a footnote.[^1]

[^1]: This is the footnote content.
```

This is particularly useful in [Digital Garden](Digital Garden) notes for citing sources.
