# Goals-Signals-Metrics (GSM) Model

The **Goals-Signals-Metrics (GSM) Model** is a three-step methodology for translating abstract objectives into measurable outcomes. It originated at Google and provides a straightforward approach to implementing measurement frameworks.

## The Three-Step Process

### Goals
**Goals** represent broad, high-level objectives that align with user needs and business strategy. They answer the question: "What are we trying to achieve?"

Goals should be:
- Aligned with user needs and business strategy
- Broad enough to encompass multiple potential solutions
- Clear enough to guide decision-making

### Signals
**Signals** are observable indicators that suggest progress toward goals. They answer the question: "What would indicate we're making progress?"

Signals should be:
- Observable behaviors or outcomes
- Directly related to the goal
- Measurable in principle (even if not yet quantified)

### Metrics
**Metrics** are the quantifiable data points that provide concrete measurement of success or failure. They answer the question: "How do we measure the signals?"

Metrics should be:
- Quantifiable and trackable
- Reliable and consistent
- Actionable (changes in metrics should inform decisions)

## Example: HEART Framework Application

The GSM model is used with the [HEART Framework](heart-framework) to measure user experience:

| Category       | Goals                          | Signals                                          | Metrics                                           |
|----------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Happiness**  | How satisfied users are         | Users' feedback from surveys and interviews      | Rating (of satisfaction), NPS                     |
| **Engagement** | Content discovery for users     | How long users spend in the digital solution     | Page views, shares, average session length        |
| **Adoption**   | Users' onboarding               | Downloads of apps, new features, new registrations | Rates of download, registration, feature adoption |
| **Retention**  | Loyalty of users                | Returning users, subscription renewals           | Churn rate, subscription renewal rate             |
| **Task Success** | Completion of users' goals    | Usability studies, behavior of users             | Task completion                                   |

## Why It Matters

The GSM model provides a systematic way to:
- **Bridge the gap** between abstract goals and concrete measurements
- **Ensure alignment** between what you want to achieve and what you're measuring
- **Avoid measuring the wrong things** by explicitly connecting metrics to goals through signals
- **Enable data-driven decisions** by creating clear measurement frameworks

## Implementation Process

1. **Define Goals**: Start with high-level objectives aligned with user needs and business strategy
2. **Identify Signals**: Determine what observable indicators would suggest progress toward each goal
3. **Select Metrics**: Choose quantifiable measures that capture the signals effectively
4. **Iterate**: Refine goals, signals, and metrics based on what you learn
