**Growth Mindset vs Fixed Mindset** (Carol Dweck): How beliefs about abilities affect learning, performance, and resilience.

## The Two Mindsets

**Fixed Mindset**: Abilities are fixed traits. Avoids challenges, gives up easily, sees effort as fruitless, feels threatened by others' success.

**Growth Mindset**: Abilities can be developed. Embraces challenges, persists through setbacks, sees effort as path to mastery, learns from criticism.

## Impact

- **Learning**: Fixed avoids learning; Growth sees it as opportunity
- **Performance**: Fixed proves ability; Growth improves ability
- **Failure**: Fixed sees it as devastating; Growth sees it as feedback

## Developing Growth Mindset

- Reframe: "I can't do this" → "I can't do this yet"
- Focus on process over results
- Value effort and learning

## Nuances

- Not everything is malleable; balance realism with growth
- Environment and resources matter; mindset alone isn't sufficient
- Don't use to blame people or ignore real limitations
