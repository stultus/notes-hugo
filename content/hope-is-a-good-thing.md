**"Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."**
- Andy Dufresne (Stephen King), *Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption*

Hope sustains us through darkness and drives action when all seems lost. Unlike naive optimism, hope acknowledges reality but believes in possibility. Unlike despair, hope is active and open to change.

## Key Distinctions

- **Hope vs Optimism**: Hope believes possibility exists even when unlikely; optimism expects positive outcomes
- **Hope vs Despair**: Despair is passive and final; hope is active and open
- **Hope vs Denial**: Hope sees darkness but looks for light; denial ignores reality
