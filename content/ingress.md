**Ingress** is an augmented reality (AR) mobile game developed by Niantic (originally an internal Google startup). Released in 2012, the game requires players to physically travel to real-world locations to interact with virtual "portals."

## Gameplay

Players choose between two factions and compete to:
- Capture and link portals at real-world locations
- Create control fields over geographic areas
- Visit physical landmarks and points of interest

The game mechanics require actual physical movement, making it distinct from traditional mobile games.

## Potential Data Collection for Mapping

There are unconfirmed reports that Ingress was used to collect pedestrian path data to improve [Google Maps](google-maps):

- **Player movement patterns**: As players walked to portals, their phones tracked accessible pedestrian routes
- **Location verification**: Player visits confirmed the accessibility and existence of locations
- **Indoor/outdoor paths**: Game data could reveal which areas are walkable vs. vehicle-only

This data would be valuable for:
- Improving pedestrian navigation
- Identifying walkable shortcuts
- Mapping areas with limited street view coverage
- Understanding foot traffic patterns

**Note**: While this connection seems logical given Niantic's origins as a Google company, reliable sources confirming this specific use case are limited.

## Legacy

Ingress served as the foundation for Niantic's later success with Pokémon GO, which used similar AR mechanics and location-based gameplay.
