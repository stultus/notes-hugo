An **Internal Platform** is the infrastructure, tooling, and services built specifically for use by developers within an organization. It serves as the foundation for software delivery and operations.

## Purpose

Internal platforms aim to:
- Reduce cognitive load on developers
- Standardize common workflows
- Enable self-service infrastructure provisioning
- Improve developer productivity and experience
- Accelerate software delivery

## Platform as Product

When treated as an internal product (see [Platform Engineering](platform-engineering)), internal platforms become strategic assets that:
- Amplify the effectiveness of other investments (including [AI Adoption](ai-adoption))
- Improve developer satisfaction and retention
- Enable faster innovation cycles

## Components

Typical internal platform components:
- Container orchestration (Kubernetes, etc.)
- CI/CD pipelines
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools
- Monitoring and logging
- Secret management
- Service mesh and networking
- Developer portals and documentation

- [Platform Engineering](platform-engineering)
- [Engineering Strategy](engineering-strategy)
- [AI Adoption](ai-adoption)
