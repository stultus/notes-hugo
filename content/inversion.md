**Inversion** involves looking at a problem or decision from the opposite point of view. Rather than focusing on achieving success, inversion encourages you to consider how to avoid failure.

## Core Principle

Flip the perspective: instead of asking "How do I succeed?", ask "How do I avoid failing?"

## Applications

- **Decision-making**: Consider what could go wrong before pursuing what could go right
- **Problem-solving**: Identify what not to do, then work backwards
- **Risk management**: Focus on preventing mistakes rather than optimizing for success
- **Strategy**: Understand failure modes to better design success paths
