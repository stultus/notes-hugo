I first encountered the term **"jerry rigging"** on Reddit. It's a new word for me, and I was curious about its origins.

**Jerry rigging** means to make a makeshift repair or construct something quickly using only the materials at hand, often resulting in a crude or improvised structure. It is widely used in everyday speech.

## Etymology

The term "jerry rigging" is a blend or variant of two separate, older expressions:

**Jury-rigged**: This is the original nautical term, dating back to the late 18th century, where "jury" meant "makeshift" or "temporary". A "jury mast," for example, was a temporary replacement mast put up after the original was lost in an emergency. This term emphasizes clever, temporary improvisation with limited materials to restore function.

**Jerry-built**: This term, from the 19th century, describes something that is cheaply and flimsily built using poor materials. It implies a lack of quality and care in construction, not necessarily a temporary fix.
