A **kludge** (or **kluge**) is a workaround or makeshift solution that is clumsy, inelegant, inefficient, difficult to extend, and hard to maintain. Its only benefit is that it rapidly solves an important problem using available resources.

## Famous Example

A famous example is the improvised CO2 scrubber that kept the astronauts alive on Apollo 13.

## Usage

This term is used in diverse fields such as:
- Computer science
- Aerospace engineering
- Internet slang
- Evolutionary neuroscience
- Animation
- Government

It is similar in meaning to the naval term **jury rig**.

## Etymology

The word has alternate spellings (_kludge_ and _kluge_) and pronunciations. The _Oxford English Dictionary_ cites Jackson W. Granholm's 1962 "How to Design a Kludge" article in _Datamation_ as the source, though there are examples of its use before the 1960s.

The _Jargon File_ (a.k.a. _The New Hacker's Dictionary_) differentiates _kludge_ from _kluge_: _Kluge_ seems to have the sense of 'overcomplicated', while _kludge_ has only the sense of 'poorly done'.
