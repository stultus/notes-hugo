The **Lone Genius Myth** is the idea that an individual with superhuman talents appears out of nowhere at certain points in history, free of influences or precedent, with a direct connection to God or The Muse.

## The Narrative

According to this myth:
- When inspiration comes, it strikes like a lightning bolt
- A lightbulb switches on in the genius's head
- They spend the rest of their time toiling away in isolation
- They shape the idea into a finished masterpiece
- They release it into the world to great fanfare

## Alternative: Scenius

The reality is that great ideas emerge from [Scenius](scenius)—collaborative creative communities where people support, learn from, and build upon each other's work.
