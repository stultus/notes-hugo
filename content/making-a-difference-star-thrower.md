**"I made a difference to that one."**
- The Star Thrower (Loren Eiseley)

When faced with overwhelming problems, individual actions can feel meaningless. But making a difference to even one person matters—the impact on that one is real, regardless of the scale of the problem.

The story: Someone throws stranded starfish back into the ocean, one by one. When told "you can't possibly make a difference," they respond: "I made a difference to that one."

## Why This Matters

- Individual impact is real—that one matters to them
- Overcomes paralysis from overwhelming scale
- Small actions can inspire others and accumulate
