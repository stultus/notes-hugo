**Mortality Awareness** is the practice of remembering that life is finite to help make better decisions and live more fully.

## Core Insight

"If you could walk around like that all the time, to really have that awareness that it's actually going to end. That's the trick."

## Steve Jobs's Perspective

"Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Almost everything—all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart."
