# Net Promoter Score (NPS)

**Net Promoter Score (NPS)** is a customer loyalty and satisfaction metric that measures how likely customers are to recommend a product or service to others. It's calculated based on responses to a single question: "How likely are you to recommend [product/service] to a friend or colleague?"

## The NPS Question

Customers are asked to rate their likelihood to recommend on a scale of 0-10:
- **0-6**: Detractors (unhappy customers who may damage your brand)
- **7-8**: Passives (satisfied but unenthusiastic customers)
- **9-10**: Promoters (loyal enthusiasts who will recommend your product)

## Calculation

NPS is calculated as the percentage of Promoters minus the percentage of Detractors:

```
NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors
```

The score ranges from -100 (all detractors) to +100 (all promoters). A positive score is generally considered good, with scores above 50 considered excellent.

## Why It Matters

NPS provides a simple, standardized way to:
- **Measure customer satisfaction** and loyalty
- **Track changes over time** in customer sentiment
- **Benchmark against competitors** using a widely-adopted metric
- **Identify areas for improvement** by following up with detractors

## Use in HEART Framework

NPS is commonly used to measure the **Happiness** metric in the [HEART Framework](heart-framework), which measures user attitudes, satisfaction, and emotional response to a product.

## Limitations

- **Single question**: May not capture the full complexity of customer sentiment
- **Cultural differences**: Interpretation of the scale may vary across cultures
- **Context matters**: A good NPS in one industry may be poor in another
- **Actionability**: Knowing your NPS doesn't tell you what to fix

## Best Practices

- **Follow up**: Ask detractors why they gave low scores to identify improvement areas
- **Track over time**: Monitor NPS trends rather than focusing on single scores
- **Segment**: Calculate NPS for different customer segments to identify patterns
- **Combine with other metrics**: Use NPS alongside other satisfaction and engagement metrics
