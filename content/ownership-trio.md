# Ownership Trio

The **Ownership Trio** is a framework that defines true ownership as requiring three interdependent components: **Knowledge**, **Mandate**, and **Responsibility**. All three must be present for effective ownership.

## The Three Components

### Knowledge
Understanding the system, product, or service you're responsible for. This includes:
- Technical understanding
- Business context
- User needs
- Operational realities

### Mandate
Authority to make decisions and take action. This includes:
- Decision-making power
- Ability to allocate resources
- Authority to change processes
- Control over outcomes

### Responsibility
Accountability for consequences. This includes:
- Being on-call for issues
- Handling alerting and debugging
- Rearchitecting when needed
- Owning the outcomes (good and bad)

## The Interdependence

The three components work together in a cycle:

1. **You cannot be responsible** for something you don't control. You need the **mandate**.
2. **You cannot use that mandate** effectively over something you don't understand. You need **knowledge**.
3. **You gain knowledge** only if you are fully **responsible** for the consequences of your **mandate**.

## Why It Matters

When all three components are present:
- Teams can make effective decisions
- People feel empowered and motivated
- Systems improve through learning
- Accountability is clear

When components are missing, you get [Broken Ownership Archetypes](broken-ownership-archetypes) that lead to frustration, demoralization, waste, and poor operations.
