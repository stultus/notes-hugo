**Phantom Media** is a concept analogous to Phantom Urbanism - media properties that exist primarily as financial instruments rather than as actual content or news sources.

## Origin Concept: Phantom Urbanism

The phrase **Phantom Urbanism** describes buildings built as financial instruments, unlived in, massive in scale. These are structures that exist primarily for investment purposes rather than to be inhabited or used.

## Phantom Media Hypothesis

By extension, **Phantom Media** would be:
- Media properties devoid of actual news or content
- Designed as investment vehicles rather than information sources
- Existing primarily for financial engineering
- Massive in scale but hollow in substance

## Characteristics

Potential markers of phantom media:
- Ownership by investment firms or holding companies
- Minimal actual journalism or content creation
- Focus on metrics and valuations over editorial quality
- Acquisition and consolidation strategies
- Content farms and SEO-driven "articles"
- Automated or AI-generated content at scale

## Questions to Explore

- Are there media properties that fit this description?
- How does this relate to the decline of local journalism?
- What role do private equity firms play in media consolidation?
- How does phantom media affect information ecosystems?
