**Phantom Urbanism** describes buildings built as financial instruments rather than for actual use. These structures are unlived in, massive in scale, and exist primarily for investment purposes.

## Characteristics

- Often empty or underutilized
- Designed as financial assets
- Part of speculative development

## Implications

- Creates hollow urban spaces
- Reflects financialization of real estate
- May indicate economic distortions
