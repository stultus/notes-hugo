A **Plaintiff** (also known as a claimant or complainant) is the party who initiates a lawsuit (an action) before a court. 

By doing so, the plaintiff seeks a legal remedy; if this search is successful, the court will issue judgment in favor of the plaintiff and an appropriate court order (e.g., an order for damages).

> In some jurisdictions the term "Claimant" is used instead of "Plaintiff".
