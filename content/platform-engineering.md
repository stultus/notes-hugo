**Platform Engineering** is the discipline of designing and building internal platforms that serve as products for an organization's developers, improving their experience and productivity.

## Core Principle: Platform as Product

Organizations that treat their platform as an **internal product** designed to improve developer experience see significantly greater returns on technology investments, including AI adoption.

Key aspects:
- **Developer Experience Focus**: Platform designed around developer needs
- **Self-Service Capabilities**: Developers can provision resources independently
- **Standardization**: Consistent tooling and workflows across teams
- **Automation**: Reduced manual toil and cognitive load

## Impact on AI Strategy

According to [DORA's 2025 research](https://dora.dev/research/2025/dora-report/):
- Poor developer experience and fragmented tooling hamper AI strategy effectiveness
- Well-designed platforms amplify the benefits of [AI Adoption](ai-adoption)
- Platform quality acts as a multiplier for AI investments

## Components

A robust platform typically includes:
- [Internal Platform](internal-platform) infrastructure
- CI/CD pipelines
- Monitoring and observability
- Security and compliance tooling
- Documentation and onboarding
