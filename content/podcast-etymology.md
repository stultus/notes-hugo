# Podcast Etymology

The word **"podcast"** was invented by Ben Hammersley, a British technology writer for The Guardian newspaper, in a February 2004 article.

## The Coinage

Hammersley coined the term as a blend of **"iPod"** and **"broadcast"** to describe the emerging audio blogging phenomenon, which allowed users to download internet radio shows to their devices like Apple's iPod.

## First Usage

The first ever usage of the term appeared in Hammersley's article:

> "But what to call it? Audioblogging? Podcasting? GuerillaMedia?"

This appeared in an article titled "Audible revolution" published on February 12, 2004, which explored the emerging trend of downloadable radio programming enabled by MP3 players, cheap audio software, and weblogs.

## Context

The article described how:
- MP3 players (like Apple's iPod) were becoming widespread
- Audio production software was becoming cheap or free
- Weblogging was an established part of the internet
- These factors combined to create a "new boom in amateur radio"

The term "podcasting" was one of several options Hammersley considered, alongside "audioblogging" and "GuerillaMedia", but it was "podcasting" that stuck and became the standard term.
