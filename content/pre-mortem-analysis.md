**Pre-Mortem Analysis** imagines a project has already failed, then works backward to identify what could go wrong. It overcomes optimism bias and encourages honest risk assessment.

## The Process

1. Set scenario: "It's one year from now, the project failed completely"
2. Brainstorm failure modes: List all possible reasons
3. Prioritize risks: Most likely, biggest impact, easiest to prevent
4. Develop mitigation: Prevention strategies and contingency plans

## Why It Works

- Overcomes optimism bias by forcing consideration of failure
- Creates psychological safety for honest assessment
- Identifies problems proactively before they occur
