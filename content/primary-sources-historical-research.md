**Primary sources** are original, firsthand accounts or evidence created by people who directly experienced the events. They are the most reliable foundation for research.

## Primary vs Secondary Sources

**Primary**: Created by direct participants/witnesses at the time of the event (diaries, photos, documents, interviews, artifacts)

**Secondary**: Created by people who weren't there, after the event (interpretations, analyses, summaries)

## Why They Matter

- **Accuracy**: Closest to actual truth, less distortion
- **Authenticity**: Original evidence, preserves context
- **Completeness**: Details and nuances that get lost in retelling

## How to Use

- Cross-reference multiple sources for verification
- Consider creator's perspective and potential biases
- Place in historical context
- Always question and verify—primary sources can still be biased

## Example

Ravi Menon's investigation used primary sources (production executive, actor, cinematographer's son, local resident) to debunk incorrect claims about a film's location.
