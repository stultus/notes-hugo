A **RACI Matrix** is a responsibility assignment framework that clarifies roles and decision-making authority in projects and processes.

## RACI Acronym

- **R**esponsible: Who does the work (can be multiple people)
- **A**ccountable: Who makes the final decision and owns the outcome (only one person per task)
- **C**onsulted: Who provides input before work is done (two-way communication)
- **I**nformed: Who is kept updated about progress (one-way communication)

## Key Rules

- **One Accountable per task**: Only one person can be Accountable for each task
- **Clear responsibility**: Every task must have at least one Responsible person
- **Avoid RACI confusion**: Don't assign multiple roles to the same person for the same task unnecessarily

## Purpose

RACI matrices help:
- Clarify decision-making authority
- Prevent confusion about roles and responsibilities
- Avoid bottlenecks by identifying who needs to be consulted
- Ensure accountability with clear ownership
- Improve communication by defining who needs to know what
