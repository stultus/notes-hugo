# RICE Framework

The **RICE Framework** is a prioritization methodology used in product management to evaluate and rank features, projects, or initiatives. It helps teams make data-driven decisions by scoring opportunities across four dimensions: **Reach**, **Impact**, **Confidence**, and **Effort**.

## The Four Components

### Reach
**How many users will this affect?**

Reach measures the number of people who will be affected by a feature or project within a given time period (typically per quarter). This can be measured as:
- Number of users who will interact with the feature
- Number of customers affected
- Percentage of user base reached

### Impact
**How significantly will it move our business goals?**

Impact measures how much the feature will contribute to business goals. Typically scored on a scale:
- **3** = Massive impact
- **2** = High impact
- **1** = Medium impact
- **0.5** = Low impact
- **0.25** = Minimal impact

### Confidence
**How sure are we that this will work (do we have data)?**

Confidence reflects how certain you are about your Reach and Impact estimates. Expressed as a percentage:
- **100%** = High confidence (strong data)
- **80%** = Medium confidence (some data)
- **50%** = Low confidence (mostly assumptions)

### Effort
**How expensive is it to build and maintain?**

Effort measures the total amount of work required, typically in person-months. This includes:
- Development time
- Design time
- Testing
- Maintenance overhead

## Calculation

The RICE score is calculated as:

```
RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort
```

Higher scores indicate higher priority. The framework helps balance:
- **High value, low effort** (quick wins)
- **High value, high effort** (strategic initiatives)
- **Low value, low effort** (may not be worth it)
- **Low value, high effort** (definitely avoid)

## Why It Matters

The RICE framework provides:
- **Data-driven prioritization** instead of gut feelings
- **Transparency** in decision-making process
- **Alignment** across teams on what to build
- **Efficiency** by focusing on high-impact, low-effort work

## Limitations

- **Estimates can be wrong**: Reach, Impact, and Effort are all estimates
- **Context matters**: Scores should be compared within similar contexts
- **Not everything is quantifiable**: Some important work may score low
- **Requires discipline**: Teams must consistently apply the framework
