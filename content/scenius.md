**Scenius** is an ecology of talent—a group of creative individuals (artists, curators, thinkers, and other tastemakers) who make up a collaborative creative scene.

## Characteristics

A scenius is a whole scene of people who:
- Support each other
- Look at each other's work
- Copy from each other
- Steal ideas and contribute ideas

## Core Principle

Good work isn't created in a vacuum. Creativity is always, in some sense, a collaboration—the result of a mind connected to other minds.

## Opposite of Lone Genius

Scenius stands in contrast to the "Lone Genius" myth—the idea that great work emerges from isolated individuals with superhuman talents appearing out of nowhere.

## Finding a Scenius

- Pay attention to what others are sharing
- Take note of what they're not sharing
- Look for voids you can fill with your own efforts
- No matter how bad they are first
