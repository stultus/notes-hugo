Arnav Kumar proposes a structured framework for writing decision documents that accelerate approval processes and demonstrate leadership maturity.

## Core Principle: Write Everything Down

Avoid verbal-only conversations. Create comprehensive written documents that serve as clear communication artifacts and decision records.

## Five Essential Components

### 1. Final Recommendation (Summary)
- State the outcome clearly upfront
- Make it easy for decision-makers to understand what you're proposing
- Lead with the answer, not the journey

### 2. Stream of Thought (Reasoning)
- Show how you arrived at your recommendation
- Include calculations, modeling, and assumptions
- Make it easy for people to stress-test your thinking
- Demonstrate rigorous analysis

### 3. Action Items (Execution Plan)
- List concrete steps to reach the recommended state
- Include success metrics and goals
- Define timelines and milestones
- Make the execution plan crystal clear

### 4. Pre-Mortem Summary (Risk Analysis)
- Identify what could go wrong
- List things to watch out for
- Show you've thought through edge cases
- Demonstrate you've covered all bases

### 5. Cost Implications (Resource Requirements)
- Detail resources needed
- Clarify budget requirements
- Make it easy to understand what you're asking for
- Enable informed resource allocation decisions

## Benefits

According to Kumar, this framework delivers:
- **10x faster approvals**: Decision-makers have everything they need
- **Reduced back-and-forth**: Comprehensive documentation preempts questions
- **Leadership credibility**: Demonstrates maturity and thoroughness
- **Better decisions**: Forces rigorous thinking and planning
- **Influence and persuasion**: Shows systematic thinking ability

## Context

This is one of many frameworks for decision documentation. Other notable approaches include:
- [Amazon's 6-Pager](../../amazon-6-pager/) - Narrative-driven decision documents
- [RACI Matrix](../../raci-matrix/) - Responsibility assignment frameworks
- [Architecture Decision Records](../../architecture-decision-records/) - Technical decision documentation
- [Request for Comments](../../request-for-comments/) - Collaborative decision-making process

## Atomic Notes

- [Pre-Mortem Analysis](../../pre-mortem-analysis/)

This framework could also inform notes on:
- Decision-making processes
- Leadership communication
- Documentation best practices
