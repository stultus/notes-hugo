## The Poem

**Passion not spent**

What's my great fear?

I'll tell you; come near.

To lay down in death

with so much left.

Passion not spent -

Oh cowardly regret!

For fear of others?

The thousand deaths.

I'm afraid to die

With no twinkle in my eye

To pass meagerly by

Yet hidden inside.     

To walk through life

Not truly alive

And to pass in the night

With an unfelt "goodbye".
