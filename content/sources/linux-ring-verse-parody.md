## The Verse

One OS to rule them all,

One OS to find them.

One OS to call them all,

And in salvation bind them.

In the bright land of Linux,

Where the hackers play.

## Context

### Original Verse
From *The Lord of the Rings* by J.R.R. Tolkien:

> One Ring to rule them all,  
> One Ring to find them,  
> One Ring to bring them all,  
> and in the darkness bind them,  
> In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.

### The Parody
Transforms Tolkien's ominous verse about the One Ring's power into a celebration of:
- **Linux** as the unifying operating system
- **Salvation** instead of darkness (freedom from proprietary software)
- **Bright land** instead of Mordor (open source community)
- **Hackers** (in the original positive sense) instead of shadows

## Themes

### Open Source Philosophy
