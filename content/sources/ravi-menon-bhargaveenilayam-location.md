## Key Investigation Findings

### The Claim
A TV channel reported that the classic Malayalam film "Bhargavee Nilayam" (1964) was shot at the historic DFO Bungalow in Nilambur, and that the forest department plans to convert it into a museum.

### The Reality
Through interviews with key people involved in the film, Ravi Menon establishes the actual filming locations:

**യഥാർത്ഥ ചിത്രീകരണ സ്ഥലങ്ങൾ:**

1. **ചെന്നൈ വാഹിനി സ്റ്റുഡിയോ**: പ്രേതഭവന രംഗങ്ങൾ (ഇൻഡോർ സെറ്റ്)
2. **തലശ്ശേരി തലായി കടപ്പുറം**: വാതിൽപ്പുറ രംഗങ്ങൾ, "ഏകാന്തതയുടെ അപാരതീരം" പാട്ട്

</div>

### Sources Interviewed

1. **R.S. Prabhu** (93 years old, Production Executive)
   - "Bhargavee Nilayam's entire work was done in Chennai and Thalassery. We never even thought of going to Nilambur."

2. **Madhu** (Lead Actor)
   - "That entire house was shot on a set in Chennai. Some exterior parts at Thalai. We never went to Nilambur."

3. **Jayanan Vincent** (Son of director Aloysius Vincent, renowned cinematographer)
   - "Indoor work was shot on sets in Chennai, outdoor scenes in Thalassery. It's unethical to distort history."

4. **Krishnachandran** (Nilambur resident)
   - Confirms no one in Nilambur knew about such filming
   - Notes that another film "Prethangalude Thazhvara" (directed by Venu) was actually shot at the DFO Bungalow

### The Confusion

The post suggests the TV channel may have confused two ghost films:
- **Bhargavee Nilayam** (1964) - Shot in Chennai and Thalassery
- **Prethangalude Thazhvara** - Actually shot at Nilambur DFO Bungalow
