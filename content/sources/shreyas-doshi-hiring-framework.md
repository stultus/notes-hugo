## The Framework

When hiring Product Managers (and potentially other roles), understand which qualities fall into three categories:

### Coachable
Skills where **external help makes a pretty substantial difference** (you still have to do the work):
- Tactics
- Process
- Critical thinking
- Communication
- Domain knowledge

### Learnable
Skills that **need external help, but the biggest battle is internal, by far**:
- Cognitive empathy
- High agency
- Deep focus
- Judgment
- Creativity

### Intrinsic
Qualities that are **largely inborn or acquired in childhood**:
- Drive
- Integrity
- Curiosity
- Deep care
- Ownership

## Key Insights

### On Intrinsic Qualities
- Sometimes binary (e.g., "there is no such thing as 'medium integrity' because medium integrity is low integrity")
- Major changes usually (but not always) come from major life transformations
- Otherwise can take decades to change

### Hiring Implications
- **Coachable**: Can be developed with training and mentorship
- **Learnable**: Requires self-motivation and internal work, external help is secondary
- **Intrinsic**: Screen for these during hiring; very difficult to develop later

### Applicability
While framed for Product Managers, this framework applies broadly to:
- Engineering roles
- Leadership positions
- Any knowledge work requiring judgment and ownership

## Discussion Points

From the comments:
- **Andrey F.** notes that some "intrinsic" attributes can be adjusted with the right techniques (references Rich Divine's book "The Attributes")
- **Kiran Somanchi** suggests a broader CAR framework: Capacity, Achievements, Relationships
- **Raheem Ashrafi** questions how to demonstrate soft skills in early interview stages
