# Story

At its core, a story is more than just a sequence of events; it is a vehicle for emotional experience and transformation.

## Definition
**Story** is the recounting of a character's journey—both external and internal—driven by desire and conflict, leading to change.

## Three Elements of Story

1. **Character**
   A strong character, typically the protagonist, should evoke empathy from the audience. This can be achieved by making the character likable, humorous, or powerful, while also placing them in jeopardy.

2. **Desire**
   The protagonist must pursue a clear and compelling goal, allowing the audience to understand the stakes of their journey.

3. **Conflict**
   The obstacles faced by the protagonist are paramount in driving the story and maintaining audience engagement, as these challenges generate emotional investment.
