The **Theory of Constraints** states that a system is only as strong as its weakest point. The focus should be on identifying and addressing the bottleneck rather than optimizing individual components.

## Core Principle

"A chain is no stronger than its weakest link."

## Key Insight

Counterintuitively, if you break down the entire system and optimize each component individually, you'll lower the effectiveness of the system. Optimize the entire system instead.

## Approach

- Identify the bottleneck (constraint)
- Focus improvement efforts on the constraint
- Optimize the system as a whole, not individual parts
