**Value Stream Mapping** (VSM) is a lean management technique for visualizing and analyzing the flow of materials and information required to deliver a product or service to customers.

## Purpose

VSM helps organizations:
- Identify waste and bottlenecks in processes
- Understand the current state of work flow
- Design improved future states
- Focus improvement efforts on high-impact areas

## VSM as AI Force Multiplier

According to [DORA's 2025 research](https://dora.dev/research/2025/dora-report/), Value Stream Mapping acts as a **force multiplier for AI investments**:

- **Systems-level view**: Ensures AI is applied to the right problems
- **Focused improvements**: Identifies where AI can have greatest impact
- **Prevents chaos**: Stops localized productivity gains from creating downstream bottlenecks
- **Organizational advantage**: Turns individual gains into system-wide improvements

Without VSM, AI adoption risks creating more work downstream or optimizing the wrong parts of the system.

## Key Components

A value stream map typically shows:
- Process steps
- Information flow
- Material flow
- Wait times and delays
- Value-added vs. non-value-added activities
- Lead time and cycle time
